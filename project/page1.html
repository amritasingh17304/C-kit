<h1>Hello World C program</h1>
<p><h3>#include < stdio.h> <br>int main()<br>{<br>printf("HELLO WORLD");<br>return 0;<br>}<br></h3></p>
<h3>Write the above code in any compiler and you will see the output on the screen as hello world.<br>
So,Congratulations you have finally made your first C program </h3>
<p><h2>Let us learn what each and every line of the code meant</h3>
<h3>Firstly "#include < stdio.h> is actually used to include all the header files in the program.<br>Without this you won't get access to any of the features available in the C language."<br><br>Next is the int main() which is the place where every C file starts to execute.<br>Here int implies the return type of the function.<br>int is a datatype which we will learn further.<br><br>return 0 means the value returned after the function is called.<br>It denotes the success of the program</h3></p>
<p><h3>The printf statement is the same as the name implies.<br>It prints the value written inside it.</h3></p>
